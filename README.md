# Image-Classifier
Deep learning based neural network for classifying flowers using PyTorch 

In this project,we trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 

We trained this classifier, then exported it in our application. We'll be using a dataset of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content
